FAME (Facial Androgyny Measure & Estimation) is a tool that estimates the masculinity/femininity of a human face using facial landmark information from dlib. FAME uses a scale of 0 (most masculine) to 6 (most feminine). This can be helpful in examining how gender appearance on a scale affects behavior, rather than just considering binary gender.

FAME was trained using linear regression (sklearn.linear_model.Lasso) with 10-fold cross validation. FAME used a sample of ~1100 images from the UTKFace dataset for training. The FAME ratings used for training were obtained from mturk workers. The training was done with FAME_training.py

The coefficients and intercept of the trained model are located in the folder saved_model

FAME_run.py runs the model on a set of 100 faces and its predictions for these are located in the folder predictions
The files have URLS to view the face image.
